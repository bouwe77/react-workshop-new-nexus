What have we learned?
1) setState for objects with ...
2) Separation of concern by having a Container component responsible for state only 
   and two presentational components (Counters and Counter) with UI rendering only.
3) Passing functions as props.
4) Specifying a key for multiple instances of the same Component so React can distinguish them.
5) Difference between DOM event handlers and "domain" event handlers.
